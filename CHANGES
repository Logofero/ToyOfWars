        Version 1:

                Enter - Enter/Exit RC cars
    
        Version 2:
 
            + Fixed:
                A player could sit in hot or explode vehicles and teleport out of the map. Now you can not entering RC car when it is burning.
                When a player dies in RC Model, the camera is reset and returned to the place of boarding the vehicle. Now the camera is fixed on vehicle exploded.

                (~) Since I tested it on one player - there may be bugs with more players.

        Version 3:
    
            Status:
                Completed. I do not plan to release updates: No personal motivation, no time, no desire, no feedback.
            
            Bugs:
                - I was unable to find the reason for which the pickups are sometimes many times in one place or has not been created. Perhaps the reason SetTimerEx timer that is used to re-create a pickup. Who knows why fix.
                - If the new map will contain less than the previous teams, the players will not be visible in the list of 'Team Score'. I wanted to fix it, but did not.
                - I could not find a good way to recover deleted objects. For this, try not to remove the ground to avoid the holes.
                
            - Removed Command /tank - create RCTiger
            - Rename TW_hud.inc to TW_gui.inc
            + Refactoring code:

            + Change font color for map description in TW_gui.inc.
            + Change window victorious, and now it shows all the points scored and the teams ranks. Grades do not mean anything - it's just an additional reward for the number of wins in the round.
            + Added sound. When the player selects the pickup when the cartridges run out audible click and when the round ends with a winning melody plays.
            + Now bonuses are seen on the radar as icons.
            + Added plugin Streamer it allows you to manage dynamic objects.
            + Added plugin ColAndreas to him, now the shells explode in a collision with objects rather than pass through them as all pickups are relative to the ground - before the pick-up can appear under the ground.
            + Added a new bonus "Air Strike" The player picked it may cause a surgical strike on the ground.
            + Added command for admins /air - air strike
            + Added 'Map loader' file at the same time change the system resources are now the owner of a server can add to the map their teams, now they are not limited to the 6th, you can select the name, color skins. All resources maps and dynamic loading after the start of the map. Note: If the map has been removed objects by changing the location they will not appear.   
            + Added new folder scriptfiles\TW_maps
            + Changes map abase.txt "Abadone base" v2
